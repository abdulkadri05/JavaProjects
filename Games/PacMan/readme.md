Pacman Game - README
How the Game Works

In Pacman, you control Pacman as he navigates a maze filled with dots. The goal is to eat all the dots while avoiding the ghosts that chase you. If a ghost catches Pacman, you lose a life. The game ends when all lives are lost.
Power Pellets

Scattered around the maze are larger dots called Power Pellets. When Pacman eats one, the ghosts turn blue and can be eaten for bonus points. The effect wears off after a short time, so use it wisely!
Winning and Losing

    Win: Clear the maze by eating all the dots.
    Lose: Lose all lives by getting caught by the ghosts.

Enjoy the game!
